# Covid-19 Geographical Analysis

This is a simple plotly based application for plotting country wise COVID-19 Cases.

The dataset used here can be obtained from the JHU CSSE COVID-19 dataset which updates daily.

The Next step for this project is to deploy the plotly graph and to update the data automatically on a daily basis.
